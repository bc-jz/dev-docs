Not all fields are required. For a syntax example of syntax, see the [Create an Order](/api/v2/#create-an-order) endpoint.<br><br> In GET and other operations, the `shipping_addresses` object will consist of two addresses. The first is the URI of a JSON object containing the shipping address details. The second is a context path that provides an alternate means of retrieving the data (if, for example, you prefer XML). For syntax, refer to the [List Orders](/api/v2/#list-orders) endpoint. |
